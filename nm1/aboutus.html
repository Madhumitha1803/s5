    <h1>RESTAURANT FEATURES</h1>

    <blockquote>
        "A restaurant can do everything right, but if the service is not up to the mark, nobody will go there."

    <h2>1: QUALITY SERVICE</h2>

    <p>
        The quality of customer service received in your restaurant is going to be one of the most memorable aspects, and it’s also hugely influential on the ambiance within your restaurant. Customer service can make or break someone’s experience!
    </p>
    <p>
        Investing in the right staff is essential to the success of your restaurant. Each member of your team acts as an extension of your brand and should reflect the ethos you want your restaurant to portray to your customers. Friendly staff full of personality with outstanding communication skills will go a long way in helping you to shape a fantastic experience and ambiance that will give your customers something to rave about!
    </p>

    <h2>2: UNIQUE AND ON-BRAND DÉCOR</h2>
    <img src="decor.jpg" alt="Decor Image">
    <p>
        As we've previously posted about, a restaurant's interior should be designed to reflect its cuisine as a way of strengthening your overall brand identity. When paired with food, service, and music, the interior design of your restaurant contributes to the overall ambiance felt in the space, whilst also molding the customer experience.
    </p>
    
    <h2>3: SUITABLE COLOUR SCHEME</h2>
    <img src="color.jpg" alt="Color Scheme Image">
    <p>
        Everyone subconsciously uses color to assess and judge the places we encounter on a daily basis, and it's particularly significant to the bar and restaurant industry. A restaurant's color scheme immediately communicates a message to customers walking through the door, even going as far as influencing appetite and energy levels!
 As a general rule, bright and vibrant colors are linked to fast food restaurants, whereas softer color schemes are better suited for restaurants that want their customers to stay for longer periods of time.
